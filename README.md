# transferfilesbetweenvirtualboxvms

Sometimes the bidirectional menu does not work. even after installing the Virtual Box guest edition.
But you still need to transfer files. there are several ways to do it!
1. set up a ftp server
2. use scp
3. use Python if available.

# With python3:
py -m http.server 8000


# with python2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
